Welcome to Funbotics documentation!
===================================

**Our mission** is to introduce robotics and STEM to middle schoolers 
to prepare them for success in a technology driven world. Targeting 
communities that are typically underrepresented in STEM, we seek to 
break down barriers to entry into STEM careers for all.

More information can be found on our `official website <https://funbotics.org/>`_.
